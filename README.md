# USC Schedule Planner
A web app I'm creating to help USC students with planning their schedules.

Features planned:
* Course list (updated weekly, straight from classes.usc.edu)
* Requirement list (inputed manually by the student, specifies specific single or multiple courses along with GE requirements)
* Day scheduler (classes are inputted automatically, but additional events can also be planned)
* Map of campus (will show the classes for the day on a map, and MIGHT show the most efficient route across campus to each class)
* iCal exporter (using the USC Academic Calendar found online to populate the specific dates)


Some specifics:
* Students can create their own login, but MUST NOT use a username or password that is used in other accounts, as the login for these accounts are NOT secured
* * Alternatively
