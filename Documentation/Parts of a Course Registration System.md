# Parts of a Course Reg System

## Tabs/Categories

- Employed by USC Webreg and Dartmouth's Office of the Registrar
  - This includes a variety of tabs (usually at the top) that allows selection between various pieces of information
  - (usually a main course page and a calendar)
  - (could also have tabs related to tuition, or faculty information) (**likely unnecessary?**)
- **Useful to keep because is something employed by USC WebReg and is familliar**
- Improvements:
  - Just sleeker/cleaner
  - Less of them (will happen naturally)
  - ? what else

## Search

- Is the main (but not the only) source of finding classes for students
- All course reg pages have this, but is usually employed differently based on the school
- Usually has a normal search and an advanced search that allows for additional filters based on specific course attributes
  - Advanced search also sometimes includes standard advanced google stuff (includes all/any/none/exactly these phrases)
- However, the search should support most things dynamically and in a basic method, and not require additional selection (**like WebReg** and unlike Penn State/UMich)
- What **WebReg** doesn't employ, is the ability to search for a specific course/plaintext title through the base search bar and instead forces you to search specifically for the department abbr.

## Default Page

- Varies vastly based on the system
- Most unsuccessful default pages are blank, and some successful default pages have the different schools/faculties that can be filtered down (just like **WebReg**)

## Course Blocks

- The standard unit to look at a course
- Good course blocks have only the necessary info visible at a glance (date and time, units, professor, seats) and bad ones are verbose and overwhelming (like Brown's)
- Some course blocks allow for direct addition to the course bin (**WebReg**)
- Depending on the class, some course blocks also include their classification (lecture, lab, quiz) (like **WebReg**)
- **WebReg** specifically also includes the option to add a course to the course bin without having it on the calendar/in checkout
- Improvements:
  - be simple at a glance when expanded, and should require an additional expansion/detail button to get more details about it
  - Should look more like individual blocks (clearly bordered?) like classes.usc.edu or like harvard
  - Note: add on harvard's style of displaying dates and times

## Course Bin

- Can only talk about USC **WebReg** in this category
- The place where all the added courses are
- Courses added in the course bin are usually visible in the calendar
- nothing much else to say? lmao
- Improvements:
  - Same as course blocks really
  - Save space (there's so much whitespace!)

## Calendar

- Can also only talk about USC **WebReg** in regards to this
- Shows all of the possible times along with brief descriptions of the course
- Improvements:
  - Show only relevant information in each little class block
  - differentiate each class block based on colour
  - Show the calendar as a tab thing on the side

Start with just the class name, units, and requirements for the majorca
